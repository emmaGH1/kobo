# Current state

## Setup lane
- [x] Scaffold Next.js App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind and real shadcn/ui initialization (no product components).
- [x] Install pnpm tooling, better-sqlite3, Drizzle, drizzle-kit and Vitest; permit only necessary native builds explicitly.
- [x] Commit scaffold checkpoint: 2195a62.
- [x] Define channel-neutral message/confirm/edit/cancel types and plain-text choices; document invariants and lane ownership. Contracts/docs checkpoint: c1b861c.
- [x] Prepare Caddy + systemd VPS templates; not installed/activated.
- [x] Typecheck, lint, 1 offline in-memory SQLite/Drizzle test and production build passed; no peer dependency issues.
- [x] Private GitHub repo verified: https://github.com/emmaGH1/kobo; main/core/design/docs created and pushed.
- [x] Production placeholder visually inspected at http://127.0.0.1:3000: HTTP 200, expected honest setup copy, assets loaded, no console entries. This is loopback HTTP only, not public HTTPS.
- [x] Git ignore checks passed for env files, SQLite and journals, recordings, results and voice-harness paths. Git contains only the new app scaffold; no private harness assets were copied.
- [ ] External HTTPS: blocked by missing domain/DNS and privileged Caddy/systemd activation. No live HTTPS URL established.

No features implemented. No API calls were made and no voice harness files changed. HANDOVER.md intentionally starts as a blank template at the owner's request; this file records initial setup evidence.

## Core lane
Not started. Owns src/core/, src/server/, src/app/api/, src/app/dev/, db/. Shared contract types exist; handlers, schema, arithmetic, authentication and integrations do not.

## Design lane
Design probe round 1 written: docs/DESIGN.md plus logo review sheet. **Awaiting owner approval.** No UI built. Owns src/components/ and src/app/(app)/. Real shadcn init configuration/utils/themes exist, no component library copied by hand.

## Docs lane
Initial setup documents exist. Official rubric/submission requirements remain unverified.

## Next single action
Owner supplies the domain/subdomain and arranges the administrator activation step in docs/DEPLOYMENT.md. Do not start product features in this setup thread.
